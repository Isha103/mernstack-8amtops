<!-- 
 Application security" in computing refers to the practice of implementing measures to protect software applications from threats and 
 vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle, including design, development, deployment, and operation, by safeguarding sensitive data 
 and code from unauthorized access, modification, or misuse, often achieved through secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments,
 and security testing.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):
Tools that help detect security vulnerabilities by executing code and inspecting it at runtime.

Static Application Security Testing (SAST):
Scans source code, bytecode, or binary code to detect coding flaws and security vulnerabilities.
