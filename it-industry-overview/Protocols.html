what is protocol?

In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols
are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different
software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.

    Examples:
    1. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):
    This protocol defines how information is transmitted and formatted over the web. It also specifies
    how web servers and browsers respond to comm   

    2.File Transfer Protocol (FTP):
    This protocol allows users to transfer files between two machines. It is also a program that 
    facilitates the sharing of files remotely.

    3.Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    This protocol separates data into packets that are then sent to their destination by routers and
    switches.
