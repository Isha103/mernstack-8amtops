what is software architecture?
Software architecture is the structure and organization of a software system,
including how its components interact, and the principles used to design it. It
also considers the environment in which the software operates.

    Examples:
    1.Microservices
    An application is broken down into small, independent services that 
    communicate with each other.
    
    2.Layered
    Code is organized into layers, with each layer providing services to the
    next higher layer.
    
    3.Event-driven
    Components generate events when their state changes, and other components
    respond by executing actions.
    
    4.Space-based
    Data and processing are distributed among multiple nodes, which can be 
    useful for applications with variable user volumes.
