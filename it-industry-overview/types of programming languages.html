<!-- 
types of programming languages:
    There are several types of programming languages, including machine language,
    assembly language, high-level languages, interpreted languages, compiled 
    languages, and markup languages.

    1.Machine language 
    The language of machines, which is made up of bits. It's easy for the
    computer to understand, but difficult for the programmer.

    2.Assembly language 
    Uses numbers and English commands instead of the bits of machine language.
    An assembler assembles the assembly code before the computer runs it.

    3.High-level languages 
    A type of programming language that's easier for programmers to understand
    than machine language.

    4.Interpreted languages 
    A type of programming language that includes Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.

    5.Compiled languages 
    A type of programming language that includes C, C++, and C#. Compiled
    languages are converted into machine code, making them faster to execute.

    6.Markup languages 
    A type of programming language that includes Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
