what is network layer on client server?

Layer 7 is the application layer and highest level of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model,
a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct 
categories.
 
    7th layers :

        Physical Layer: The first layer, which manages how data is transmitted over physical connections like
        cables, switches, and routers 

        Data Link Layer: The second layer, which handles data transfer between two connected nodes 

        Network Layer: The third layer, which handles routing and forwarding data packets 

        Transport Layer: The fourth layer, which ensures data is transmitted in order and without duplication 

        Session Layer: The fifth layer 

        Presentation Layer: The sixth layer 

        Application Layer: The seventh layer
