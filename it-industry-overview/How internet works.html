Computers connect to each other and to the Internet via wires, cables, radio waves, and other types
of networking infrastructure. All data sent over the Internet is translated into pulses of light or
electricity, also called "bits," and then interpreted by the receiving computer.

How the internet works:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Delivers web content like images, files, and web pages.
Internet Protocol (IP): Formats and addresses data packets.
