    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    
    <p>This is the first paragraph of text on this page. HTML paragraphs are used to group related sentences together.</p>
    
    <p>This is the second paragraph. Each paragraph tag wraps around the text to create a block of content, making it easier to read.</p>
    
    <p>HTML allows you to add as many paragraphs as needed, creating a clean and readable structure for your page.</p>
